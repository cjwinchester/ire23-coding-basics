### Ask lots of questions!

### Outline
- Good reasons to learn to code
    - ‚úÖ You want to [automate the boring shit](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) so you can spend more time journalism-ing
    - ‚úÖ You're running into problems that your existing tools can't solve -- build out your toolbox!
    - ‚úÖ You want to challenge yourself to learn new skills
- Bad reasons to learn to code
    - ‚õîÔ∏è You're feeling career pressure 
    - ‚õîÔ∏è You want to put a new line on your resum√©
    - ‚õîÔ∏è Someone told you that everyone should learn to code
- Some common newsroom use cases
    - Working with large data files
    - Web scraping
    - Creating reusable data analysis pipelines
    - Building custom data visualizations, web pages and apps
- Your basic toolkit: Your computer's command line and a good text editor, such as [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Popular programming languages in newsrooms
    - R
    - Python
    - JavaScript, both client- and server-side (+ HTML and CSS for web development tasks)
- Which programming language should you learn?
    - What are you trying to do?
    - [What syntax feels the least icky to write?](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10bTYcXlN8Olv74ZWUR-IqNsl9sx2hrvlN9m7ofFD3ao/edit#slide=id.g30ac476f3c_0_0)
- Hello, command line!
- Core programming concepts:
    - Data types
    - Installing and importing external libraries
    - Variable assignment
    - Data collections
    - "Control flow" logic statements
        - `if` statements
        - `for` loops
    - Analogy: Nouns (objects, classes, data collections) vs. verbs (functions, methods)
- Your syntax has to be exactly correct to parse and run -- "the copy editor from hell"
- Strategies for learning to code -- adaptive problem-solving is the name of the game
    - Get used to beating your head against the wall
    - Find a project that programming can help you finish
    - Write code to recreate a project you've already completed using another tool (e.g., analyze data in an R script that you've already analyzed in Excel)
    - Googling errors to find code solutions isn't cheating -- it's a skill that can be practiced!

### Let's write some code!
- Open the `Terminal` application
- `python3 hello.py`
- `python3`
